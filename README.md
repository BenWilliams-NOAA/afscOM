# AFSC MSE Operating Model
# General design
2 - fleet
2 - survey
2 - sex

naming conventions:  
generally use snake_case

t,...,T = time (typically annual step)  
a,...,A = age, starts at >=1, A is a plus group  
l,...,L = length_bin, L is a plus group  
s = sex, 1 or 2
 if two then 1 = female, 2 = male - consider making a 3 for unsexed (e.g., unsexed size comps)


_obs = observations  
_sd = standard deviation (or cv)  
_ind = index of 1 (use) or 0 (do not use), length T


catch_obs - observed catch matrix dim T, n_fleet 
catch_sd - observed catch matrix dim T, n_fleet
catch_ind - 1 = include, 0 = exclude, matrix dim T, n_fleet

srv_obs - observed survey matrix dim TS, n_srv 
srv_sd  - observed survey matrix dim TS, n_srv
srv_ind - 1 = include, 0 = exclude, matrix dim T, n_srv

patc_obs  # proportion at age and time - catch: age comps
patc_ind  # prob not these names but the general idea is there
patc_iss
